          In this project, I developed a simple website designed to randomize
          images via an API. The current user interface is minimalistic,
          reflecting my ongoing learning journey with Tailwindcss and API
          integration. The primary function of this website is to randomize
          images of Megumin, a character from the KonoSuba series.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The main purpose of this project is to enhance my skills in web
          development, particularly focusing on the integration of APIs and the
          application of Tailwindcss for styling. By working on this project, I
          aim to improve my understanding of how to fetch and display data from
          an external source dynamically and to create a responsive and visually
          appealing user interface.
        </p>
        <b>Who is Megumin ?</b>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Megumin („ÇÅ Megumin?) is one of the main female characters in the
          KonoSuba series. She is known as the Witch of the Crimson Mazoku in a
          fantasy world and eventually joins Kazuma's group.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Megumin is a young girl characterized by her short dark brown hair and
          striking reddish-red eyes. Her typical attire includes a black robe, a
          necklace, a wizard hat, and black gloves. She also wears an eye patch,
          not out of necessity for her powers or vision, but simply because she
          believes it looks cool.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Megumin's signature ability is her mastery of Explosion Magic, which
          is extremely powerful but can only be used once per day due to the
          enormous amount of mana it consumes. Despite its limitations, she is
          passionately dedicated to this magic, often to the detriment of
          practicality in battle scenarios.
